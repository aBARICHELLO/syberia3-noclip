# How to Install
Download the DLL from the [releases tab](https://github.com/aBARICHELLO/syberia3-noclip/releases) and place it in the game's instalation folder<br>
(usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Syberia3\Syberia3_Data\Managed`).<br>
To remove the mod simply delete the replaced DLL and ask Steam to verify the game's integrity, downloading back the original file.
